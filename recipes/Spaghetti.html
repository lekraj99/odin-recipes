    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I was shown this recipe—Camp David spaghetti with Italian sausage—by a Navy chef who served it to presidents at Camp David, MD. I have served it to my family many times, and it is certainly fit for a president. It is best with a garden salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Italian sausage links, casings removed</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>       
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice sausages lengthwise, leaving them attached along one side; lay flat in a large skillet. Cook over medium heat until browned and cooked through, 5 minutes, turning once. Remove from skillet; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef, onion, garlic, and olive oil to the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until onion is translucent and beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet. Stir in tomato sauce, tomatoes, oregano, salt, basil, bay leaf, and black pepper; simmer, uncovered, over low heat until flavors have blended, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. Stir spaghetti into sauce.</li>
        <li>Divide spaghetti and sauce among oven-safe plates; top each with a cooked, opened sausage and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Place plates in the preheated oven until cheese melted and begins to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
